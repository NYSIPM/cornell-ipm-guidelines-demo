## 1.1 Pesticide Classification and Certification
Pesticides can be classified as general use or restricted use. General use pesticides may be purchased and used by anyone. Restricted use pesticides can only be purchased and used by a certified applicator or used by someone under a certified applicator’s supervision. In some cases, the pesticide label may limit use of a restricted use pesticide to only a certified applicator.
