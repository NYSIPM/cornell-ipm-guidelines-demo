## 1.1 Pesticide Classification and Certification

Pesticides can be classified as general use or restricted use. General use pesticides may be purchased and used by anyone. Restricted use pesticides can only be purchased and used by a certified applicator or used by someone under a certified applicator’s supervision. In some cases, the pesticide label may limit use of a restricted use pesticide to only a certified applicator.

### 1.1.1 Certification in New York State

Private applicators use or supervise the use of pesticides to produce agricultural commodities or forest crops on land owned or rented by the private applicator or their employer. If a private applicator wants to use or supervise the use of restricted use pesticides, they need to be a certified private applicator. Certified private applicators are also allowed to purchase restricted use pesticides. Certification is not needed if a private applicator uses general use pesticides.

In New York State, a certified commercial applicator, certified commercial technician, or commercial apprentice working under the supervision of a certified commercial applicator is allowed to apply any type of pesticide on property that is not a private application (described above) or is a residential application. (A residential application is the use of general use pesticides on property owned or rented by the applicator, excluding establishments selling or processing food and residential structures other than where the applicator lives.) Certified commercial applicators are allowed to purchase restricted use pesticides.

Information on pesticide certification and classification is available from your Cornell Cooperative Extension office ([cce.cornell.edu/localoffices](https://cce.cornell.edu/localoffices)), regional NYSDEC pesticide specialist (dec.ny.gov/about/contact-us/statewide-office-information), the Pesticide Applicator Training Manuals (www.cornellstore.com/books/cornell-cooperative-ext-pmep-manuals), or the Cornell Pesticide Safety Education Program ([psep.cce.cornell.edu](https://psep.cce.cornell.edu)).

### 1.1.2 Certification and Business Requirements in Pennsylvania

In Pennsylvania, definitions of private applicator and commercial or public applicator are similar as noted above. Additionally, pesticides may be applied by registered technicians and/or noncertified applicators under the direction of a licensed applicator.

**Private Applicators** – Private applicators are an applicator who intends to purchase and/or apply restricted-use pesticides for the purpose of producing an agricultural commodity on land that is owned or rented by that person or their employer.

**Commercial and Public Applicator** - There are 25 categories of commercial and public applicators. To be eligible for certification, a person must pass two written examinations (core and category) and be employed by a pesticide application business. Once exams have been successfully passed, that person has 12 months to apply for certification with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture.

**Application Business** – The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) defines a pesticide application business as a government entity or commercial establishment engaged in the application of pesticides and meeting the definition of a commercial or public applicator. This includes individual operators that meet the definition of a commercial or public applicator.

Businesses must be licensed to apply general or restricted-use pesticides. A license must be obtained indicating the certification category in which the business makes applications. The business must, at all times, employ an applicator certified for each category in which it intends to make a pesticide application.

Businesses must meet the requirements for comprehensive general liability insurance coverage for pesticide applications. A minimum of $200,000 coverage is required. This must include $100,000 coverage for bodily injury and $100,000 coverage for property damage per occurrence. Coverage must include a statement that pesticide applications are included, or endorsement #CG26160194 or #CG26160798.

**Registered technicians** –  Registered technicians are those applicators who have received training as required under subsection 128.51 of the Pennsylvania Pesticide Rules and Regulations. These applicators have completed minimum training requirements under the direction of an applicator with at least one year’s certification in the category for which the technician is being trained. They must also be under the supervision of a certified applicator who can be on site within five hours if necessary. Registered technicians must be re-registered and receive updated training on an annual basis.

**Noncertified Applicators** – Applications may be made by an individual who is neither certified nor a registered technician if and only if that individual is under the direct supervision of a certified applicator who is physically present and within sight of the application being made.
