## 1.9.2 Minimum-risk Pesticides

Minimum-risk pesticides are certain pesticides exempt from EPA registration under FIFRA. Since these products are not registered with the EPA, they do not have an EPA Registration Number. Minimum-risk pesticides contain only active and inert ingredients outlined in federal regulations (40 CFR 152.25(f)(1) and 40 CFR 152.25(f)(2), respectively). Minimum risk pesticides must also meet certain label requirements. Detailed information on minimum-risk pesticides is available at [www.epa.gov/minimum-risk-pesticides](www.epa.gov/minimum-risk-pesticides).
