Preparations for a berry planting must begin one to two years in advance. Select a site with good air and water drainage and have a preplant soil and a nematode analysis performed on representative soil samples. *Growers may wish to select a more broad-spectrum approach to preplant soil analysis at this time by opting for a comprehensive Cornell soil health assessment.*
